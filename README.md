# Customer Churn in Telecom Industry
## Problem Overview :
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when a customer decides to stop using your products or services. Every business faces this challenge, but itâ€™s typically more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones.
